# bensk-syntax theme

This is a fork of [Chester](https://github.com/csutter/chester-atom-syntax), my favorite syntax theme, with one tweak: it has CRAZY VISIBLE comments, which I find useful for teaching.  

Like this:

Comments are Proxima Nova (or sans-serif if your system doesn't have it) and <strike>pink</strike> visible as heck.

Enjoy!
